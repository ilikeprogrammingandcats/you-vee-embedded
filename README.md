# you-vee-embedded
This is the embedded code for the YouVee board; a custom IoT device designed for the ELC Accessible beauty hackathon. To generate the starte boilerplate, I relied on public resources from NordicSemi

For now, the device should be able to connect and pair to both Android and iPhones. It will send some dummy data which is now used as reference for the mobile app.


UPDATE: The prototypes have been flashed and will send data and alerts!
